Abstract: 
In movement science, time series data are often noisy. For example, spatiotemporal parameters measured while locomoting or maintaining upright posture often vary considerably over several minutes of observation. 
Traditional linear statistics such as the mean and standard deviation often fail to capture these time varying properties. A key feature of biological signals such as heart rate, neural activity, and human walking 
is that they entail coordination across many timescales. These scales range from milliseconds important in neuroscience to the multiple minutes that make up bouts of walking. Thus, analytical methods are required 
to address the multiscale nature of human movement and physiological data. One class of methods, collectively known as multifractal analysis, is naturally suited to this task.This workshop will introduce fractal 
theory and its relevance to the control of human movements and physiology. In addition, workshop attendees will be provided hands-on instruction in applying multifractal methods to human movement data with MATLAB. 
The hands-on instruction will also include details on best practices. Upon workshop completion, participants will acquire (1) a deeper understanding of the underlying mathematics and theory on multifractality in 
movement science, (2) software for performing analyses on their own data, and (3) knowledge on best practices for multifractal analysis in research. Workshop attendees are strongly encouraged to bring their own 
data to maximize learning during the workshop; however, example datasets will also be provided. The only prerequisites are college level algebra and a basic proficiency with MATLAB. Participants of all backgrounds 
including researchers, clinicians, and students of all levels are encouraged to attend.
